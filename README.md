# ninvax static site

This repository contains a very small static page used for ninvax's landing page.
The page simply displays the ninvax logo with purple text on a black background
and a short "Coming soon…" message.

The live site files are located in the `site/` directory.  To preview locally,
open `site/index.html` in your browser.

## Building the iOS app

To open the SwiftUI project in Xcode run:

```bash
cd NinvaxApp && open NinvaxApp.xcodeproj
```

## Environment setup

Both the `frontend` and `backend` folders contain a `.env.example` file.
Copy these templates to `.env.local` or `.env` and provide the required values
before running the applications.
