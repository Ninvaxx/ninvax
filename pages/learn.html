      <h1>Why Computer Science Matters</h1>
      <p>
        At Ninvax we believe computer science (CS) should be a core subject for
        everyone. Learning to code isn’t just about using computers—it teaches a
        way of thinking that can be applied across disciplines. Computational
        thinking, which includes identifying patterns, decomposition and
        abstraction, mirrors critical thinking and helps students actively
        engage with information【438365280779183†L44-L60】. For example, history
        students can use geographic information systems to plot election
        results and identify trends, gaining a deeper understanding of their
        subject【438365280779183†L44-L60】.

      <h2>Benefits of Computer Science Education</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Transferable skills:</strong> CS teaches creative problem
          solving, logical reasoning and persistence. Students learn to work
          cooperatively, communicate their thinking, and build stamina by
          iterating through challenges【835615229054171†L40-L47】.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Improved academic outcomes:</strong> Studies show that children
          who study computer science perform better in other subjects and are
          17 % more likely to enrol in college【835615229054171†L48-L50】.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Equity and access:</strong> Under‑represented groups—people of
          color, rural students, women, English learners, people with
          disabilities and those from low‑income backgrounds—are often excluded
          from tech fields【835615229054171†L55-L60】. Providing CS education in
          K‑12 helps close this gap and increases participation from these
          communities【835615229054171†L55-L67】.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Early exposure matters:</strong> Young women who take
          AP Computer Science in high school are ten times more likely to major
          in CS【835615229054171†L63-L69】, and early access boosts
          participation for all students.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Joyful, creative learning:</strong> CS education isn’t just
          screen‑time; it includes unplugged activities, robotics, and real‑world
          design challenges. Students build paper “computers”, act out
          algorithms, and tell animated stories with block‑based coding, which
          helps them express themselves and see how technology impacts their
          world【835615229054171†L74-L89】.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cross‑disciplinary applications:</strong> The skills from
          computational thinking—identifying patterns, narrowing down
          information, distinguishing between correlation and causation—can be
          applied in any subject【438365280779183†L62-L97】. Students become more
          agile thinkers and learn to interpret complex data sets【438365280779183†L62-L97】.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Making CS accessible to all learners aligns with our vision of
        empowering individuals to shape their own realities. By embedding
        computer science into education from an early age, we can cultivate
        future innovators, problem solvers and change‑makers.
