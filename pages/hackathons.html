      <!-- Introduction to hackathons -->
      <p>
        Hackathons are collaborative events where participants work in teams to
        build projects that address a challenge within a short timeframe. A typical
        hackathon includes an orientation session, time for teams to form and
        brainstorm, an intensive coding phase, presentations of projects, and
        judging to determine winners【82189479256576†L46-L126】. Projects can range
        from apps and chatbots to games and hardware prototypes, and events are
        often themed around current technology trends【82189479256576†L42-L50】.

        Many hackathons are beginner friendly: most events welcome anyone who
        registers and provide workshops to help newcomers get started【82189479256576†L55-L79】.
        They usually cost little to nothing to enter; in‑person hackathons
        typically provide meals so participants can focus on creating【82189479256576†L80-L85】.

        High‑school hackathons have become especially popular. In 2025 there are
        hundreds of events across the world—Hack Club lists more than 700
        upcoming high‑school hackathons in 30 states and 25 countries【47183827001825†L4-L8】.
        Elementary and middle‑school students have opportunities too; many
        competitions are open to ages 7–18 and encourage beginners to learn
        alongside more experienced coders.
