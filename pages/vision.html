      <h1>Our Vision</h1>
      <p>
        We imagine a world where technology empowers every person to shape their
        own reality. Computer science is more than coding—it’s a toolkit for
        creative problem solving, critical thinking and self‑expression. By
        teaching computational thinking skills to all learners, we help them
        develop perseverance, collaboration and communication【835615229054171†L40-L47】.
      </p>
      <p>
        This vision can only be realized if access to technology and CS
        education is equitable. Today there are stark disparities in who
        participates in computer science: people of color, women, rural
        communities, English language learners, people with disabilities and
        economically disadvantaged students remain under‑represented【835615229054171†L55-L60】.
        By introducing CS early in K‑12 and designing inclusive learning
        experiences, we can close these gaps and build a diverse community of
        creators【835615229054171†L55-L67】.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe that joy and creativity belong at the heart of learning.
        Unplugged activities, robotics challenges and real‑world design projects
        allow students to experience the power of computer science firsthand
        while expressing their own ideas【835615229054171†L74-L89】. When learners
        see how technology connects to the things they care about, they become
        empowered to use it to make positive change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Join us as we build an inclusive, glitchy future where computer science
        is a core subject and a catalyst for building a trillion‑dollar
        collective empire—together, reality hackers can bend the rules and
        reimagine what’s possible.
